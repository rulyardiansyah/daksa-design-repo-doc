          h1 Logo
          p Existance of a carefully-designed logo is one of many ways to proof professionalism aspect of a company. As a perfect analogy, a logo represent the face of company itself. No matter how great our products are, it will not matter if the face were ugly or inconsistent. Logo (&amp; corporate) design makes the ecosystem of design, and any aspects that implicitly effected by it, more consistent and coherent.

          h4 The origin
          p DAKSA logo can be presented both on light and dark backgrounds, as shown below. The logo itself were designed with no such-so-strict rule to be applied, so we can make it as dynamic and explorative as it could be. As long as the logo stands out from the surrounding elements, it is fine. But, if you were not so sure how to implement our logo, you can just follow along these two examples below.

            figcaption Origin logo on light background
          p One thing you should remember when implementing our logo within a layout with centered alignment is the center point of the logo itself. The dashed line below the lettermark 'DAKSA' was intentionally wider. Therefore, you have to appropriately center it.

          h4 Monochrome Version
          p For some cases, like outdoor billboard, cutting sticker, acrylic lettering, legal stamp, and so on, The Origin logo cannot be fully implemented. So, we should use the monochrome version of our logo instead.

          p Anatomy of our logo is a combination of a picturemark and a lettermark, which is designed in most cases are not undivide-able. Both picturemark and lettermark must be presented at the same time. Only in very limited situations the picturemark can be presented as a standalone element. But, please take a note that it is limited, you should discuss any further regarding this subject with designer or corporate team.

          h4 Clearspace
          p Respect our logo by giving it some space to breath. The minimum clearspace that must surround our logo is equivalent to twice the diameter of <strong>the hole</strong> of the picturemark. Clearspace is an empty area where any elements of design are prohibited to be placed there. A focal point should be created around our logo, so it receives more visual weight than everything.

          p The clearspace of the logo is defined by the bounded in pink lines as you can see in the illustration above. This rule should be applied to any kind of corporate and design communication media.
          h4 Minimum Size
