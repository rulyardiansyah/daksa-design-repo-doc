          h2 Things You Need to Know
          p Before we dive deeper, these are quick summary of rule &amp; basic knowledge every web developer should know &amp; obey. Just take it as your "supplies for survival" for your next journey while working with Primefaces.
          h4 Basic Knowledge
          p It means, what has written on the list are not specifically related to Primefaces overrides, it is a general knowledge of
          ul
            li More specific CSS selector will overcome the less specific one.
              p For example. <code>.ui-parent .ui-child .ui-grand-child</code> will override the values of <code>.ui-parent .ui-grand-child</code>.
            li Primefaces components always written as the very first class in the generated (X)HTML code, so let us just be focus on it.
              p Examples: A <strong>Panel</strong>, <strong>BooleanButton</strong>, <strong>Calendar</strong> component will be generated with <code>.ui-panel</code>, <code>.ui-boolean-button</code>, <code>.ui-calendar</code> as its first class respectively.
          h4 Rules
          ul
            li Make its own stylesheet file specifically for it.
            li (This point is not a mandatory) Instead of using <code>.ui-state-*</code>, please just use the native <code>:hover</code>, <code>:focus</code>, <code>:active</code>, etc..
          h4 Prohibition
          ul
            li Do not make <code>!important</code> as your saviour. Please be clean with your stylesheet.
            li Do not apply a layout-related properties to Primefaces overrides, i.e. <code>position</code>, <code>transform</code>. If necessary, just separate it to its own class or id.
            li To play safe, do not change any CSS property for following classes: <code>.ui-widget-*</code>, <code>.ui-state-*</code>, <code>.ui-corner-*</code>, <code>.ui-helper-*</code>. Just leave it as the way it is.
