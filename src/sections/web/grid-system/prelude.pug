          p Most CSS grid system framework were written the way machines read them, not the way we intuit them. Our grid system allows you to express your page grid the same way a human would describe it. More flexible, no more needlessly nesting elements, and no more rigid eight, twelve, sixteen, or twenty four column rules, whatsoever.

          p The pre-requisites? Not much. If you know how to work with CSS <strong>and</strong> <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>, then you are good to go. If not, then please go to <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> page and you will whole-heartedly happy to switch from CSS to Sass.

          h2 Is it better?
          p How many CSS grid framework can do a seven or thirteen columns grid? Almost none. Bootstrap? Foundation? They were written in a fix number of columns, so it does not give a flexibility to us. We cannot control on how many grid we would like to have.
          p How about the syntax? We have to stick to the way it has written. For example, in Bootstrap you have to follow the <code>.col</code> class syntax, where it has to be nested inside a <code>.row</code> element. If you did not follow the syntax, then you may found an unexpected result.
          p This grid framework was built to make our web design implementation much easier, faster, and foremost much cleaner (semantic markup).
