          h3 Clone DAKSA Grid System Framework
          p It is important for you to understand that this grid framework is not a one time install. In other means, this grid framework needs to be installed/cloned for every new project.
          ol
            li Change your Terminal directory to your stylesheets folder using <code>cd</code> command.
              pre.

            li Put <code>@import "dgs/index";</code> at the top of your main Sass file, for example we named it <code>main.scss</code>.
            li Then watch the <code>main.scss</code> file. (Or, if you have multiple Sass file, you can watch a folder.) by typing this command on your Terminal.
              pre.
                // Do this if you only have a single Sass file.
                sass --watch main.scss:main.css
              | Or,
              pre.
                // If you have multiple Sass file to watch.
                sass --watch css:css
              | Make sure that your Terminal is on the right directory.

          p See? As simple as that. You have the freedom to make the sizes of your column. No need to remember <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid">those</a> <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/grid.html">non-sense</a> tags' attribute matching anymore. Your HTML codes now could be a lot cleaner. You can compare on how big time saving you did by using our DGS rather than just a conventional CSS. DGS has potentials to be a part of our daily web development tool.
